# TrackApp
TrackApp is a simple Svelte-based wellness tracker that helps you log your daily habits — sleep, water intake, food, exercise, mood, and notes while tracking your progress over time.  

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Overview Dashboard** – See averages (sleep, water) and track progress against your goals.  
- 🎯 **Goals** – Set and update your habit goals (sleep, water, vegetables, fruits, exercise, mood).  
- ⚙️ **Settings** – Choose which activities you want to track.  
- 📝 **New Entry** – Log daily activities (sleep, water, food, exercise, mood, notes, feelings).  
- 📒 **Recent Entries** – Quick access to your 3 most recent entries.  
- 📂 **All Entries** – Browse and filter through your full history of entries.  
- ✏ **Edit Entries** – Update or correct past entries easily.  
- 🔔 **Notifications** – Subtle toast feedback using `svelte-sonner`.
